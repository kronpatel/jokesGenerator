## Usage

Vs Code

## Description 

The above code is a simple dad joke generator web app that displays a random dad joke from an array of jokes every time the "Generate a Dad Joke" button is clicked. 

To install and use the app, follow these steps:
1. Create a new folder on your computer and save the above code in three separate files - an HTML file named "index.html", a CSS file named "style.css", and a JavaScript file named "app.js".
2. Copy and paste the code above into the corresponding file.
3. Open the "index.html" file in a web browser to launch the app.
4. Click on the "Generate a Dad Joke" button to generate a random dad joke from the array displayed below the button.

Note that the above code assumes that the HTML file, CSS file, and JavaScript file are saved in the same folder and have the same file names specified in the code. If you save the files with different names or in different locations, you will need to update the file paths in the code accordingly.
